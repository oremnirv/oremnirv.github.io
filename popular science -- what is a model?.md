I'm going to explain what is a model, and then tell you why you should care about it. I can cite a definition from a dictionary, but aside of being dry I can also lose you with too specific wording. Another startegy is to use examples first and only then introduce a definition which its words can be anchored on the examples laid beforehand. Without examples, you hope that the anchoring of the reader is already there and that it is sufficiently close to the anchoring you yourself inteded.
